## About me: 

I'm a senior at Macalester College in St. Paul, Minnesota but I'm originally from Takoma Park, Maryland. I'm completing an Environmental Studies major with an emphasis in International Environment and Development and minors in Statistics and Latin American Studies.

I created this website through the `distill` package in R and all code is available on [my GitHub](https://github.com/miarothberg/miarothberg_distill). Learn more about using `distill` at <https://rstudio.github.io/distill>.
