      "contents": "\n\n\nHi!\nI’m currently a senior at Macalester College in St. Paul, Minnesota completing an Environmental Studies major with an emphasis in International Environment and Development and minors in Statistics and Latin American Studies.\nBefore Macalester, I spent most of my life in Takoma Park, Maryland. I focused on cellular biology when I was in the STEM Magnet program at Montgomery Blair High School, but was most drawn to the more macro interactions that I could see when I was out hiking, biking, or running. Macalester has helped me to both hone and combine my interests, allowing me to learn about international environmental policy and history and to combine that with my interest in data.\nFeel free to explore the rest of this website to learn more, or contact me at mrothber@macalester.edu\nI created this website through the distill package in R and all code is available on my GitHub. Learn more about using distill at https://rstudio.github.io/distill.\n\n\n\n",

      "contents": "\n\nContents\nForest Conservation Intern at the Montgomery County Planning Department\nCommunities Intern at the Sustainable States Network\nResearch Intern in the Catholic University of America Biology Department\n\nForest Conservation Intern at the Montgomery County Planning Department\n\n\n\n\nI have been the forest conservation intern in the Intake and Regulatory Coordination division of the Montgomery County Planning Department since June 2020. The majority of my work has been focused on the department’s Reforest Montgomery program, an initiative to fund free or reduced price trees to county residents and parks through the Forest Conservation Fund. Reforest Montgomery has five subprograms, and my roles in each have been as follows:\n\nNative tree coupon program - this is our most widely used program, allowing anyone planting a tree in the county to purchase a tree for $40 off at a participating nursery. Coupons with information including address, tree species, and price are sent to the department for reimbursement, and I log each one into our internal ArcGIS Online database.\nFree shade tree program - through this program, we organize contractors to plant about 100 trees per year on private properties in densely populated areas of the county. Anyone can apply, and I review and respond to each application. For accepted applications, usually requesting between 1 and 5 trees, I prepare a site map using ArcGIS Pro to assist my supervisor and our contractors when they conduct site visits and plant the trees. In my first months, I used Adobe Illustrator to design handouts with information on how to get involved in the program and each type of tree that we offer.\nThe first month of my internship, I used Adobe Illustrator to create handouts detailing the steps people need to take to participate in this program and the tree species they can choose from, both of which are available on the website.\n\nRe-Leaf the Reserve - this program provides large-scale reforestation projects for property owners in Montgomery County’s Agricultural Reserve. When I am in the area, I visit each site to photograph and inspect the plantings, and am working on creating a StoryMap through ArcGIS Online to document the growth.\nMontgomery Parks Reforestation - this program partners with the Montgomery County Parks Department to fund both large-scale reforestation projects and large-caliper transplants in Montgomery County Parks. My role in this program is very similar to my role in Re-Leaf the Reserve.\nForest Conservation Easement Reforestation - this program is still in it’s pilot phase, but will eventually assist homeowners anywhere in the county with a Category I Forest Conservation Easement with reforestation. In preparation for the launch of the program, I have conducted a site suitability analysis using ArcGIS Pro to identify ideal sites for reforestation and prepared site plans accordingly.\nFor the program as a whole, I write a quarterly newsletter with information about our recent projects, respond to requests for data, and manage the program email account.\nCommunities Intern at the Sustainable States Network\n\n\n\n\nI spent the fall semester of my senior year at Macalester interning with the Sustainable States Network, which is managed by the Great Plains Institute. The Sustainable States Network is a coalition of state-level organizations from 14 states around the country advocating for environmental causes. The majority of network members run programs in which municipalities in their state can receive an environmental “certification” for completing a certain number of actions, like establishing farmer’s markets or community composting programs.\n\nMy main job was designing the annual survey for Network members, asking questions about achievements, equity initiatives, and performance metrics on SurveyMonkey, and distilling the information into Padlets (like this one) for them to present at the annual meeting near the end of my internship.\nResearch Intern in the Catholic University of America Biology Department\nFrom June the summer before my senior year of high school until I graduated, I worked as a research intern in the lab of Dr. Pamela Tuma under the guidance of graduate student (current) Dr. Jennifer Groebner. While there, I assisted Dr. Groebner in her investigations of molecular mechanisms that lead to the progression of alcoholic liver disease. This internship initially started as a research project for my senior capstone but became a full year experience that lead to two published papers:\nGroebner, J.L., Girón-Bravo, M.T., Rothberg, M.L., Adhikari, R., Tuma, D.J., Tuma, P.L. “Alcohol-induced microtubule acetylation leads to the accumulation of large, immobile lipid droplets.” American Journal of Physiology (2019).\navailable here\n\nGroebner, J.L., Girón-Bravo, M., Rothberg, M., Richard, A., Adhikari, R., Tuma, P.L. “Defects in Hepatic Protein Trafficking and Lipid Droplet Motility can be Explained by Microtubule Hyperacetylation.” Gastroenterology (2018).\n\n\n\n",

      "contents": "\nMacalester Jewish Organization (MJO)\nI joined the Macalester Jewish Organization my sophomore year and became a co-president my junior year. I was raised only culturally Jewish, but I was drawn to MJO by the well-organized, strong community. As a co-president, I run our leadership meetings, help to organize hundred person services for the High Holidays, plan weekly programming including cultural meetings and Shabbats, and run our Instagram page. MJO is the only source of Jewish life on campus, so our programming is essential for religious students.\nChallah for Hunger\n\n\n\n\nI became involved with Challah for Hunger through MJO, and restarted Macalester’s chapter of the national organization my senior year after it took a pause during COVID. As president, I organized fundraising approval and arranged teams of volunteers for three multi-part bake sales a semester. One team would mix ingredients for challah, the second would braid mini challahs after it rose, and the third would sell each challah for $1 during lunch the following day. We raised about $400 in the Fall 2021 semester, increasing our fundraising by more than 400% over Fall 2019. Half of the proceeds were donated to the national organization Swipe Out Hunger and half were donated to Macalester’s Little Free Pantry.\n\nCampus Hunger Project Cohort\n\n\n\n\nEach year, Challah for Hunger national organizes a cohort of students from colleges around the country to participate in the Campus Hunger Project. As cohort fellows, we each spearhead a project on our own campus to combat food insecurity with the support of other members. For my project, I’m mentoring an underclassman and working to establish a chapter of Swipe Out Hunger on Macalester’s campus, with the long term goal of creating a meal swipe donation program.\n\n\n\n\n",

      "contents": "\nCommunication with the Masses: The Future of Ecology\nI wrote this op-ed for my Ecology and the Environment class in Fall 2019 in response to the prompt “What should the future of ecology be?” In the paper, I argue that ecologists and scientists in general must place more of an effort on non-science communication in order to stay relevant.\nThe American Empire: The Global Interior and the True International Role of the Department of the Interior\nI wrote this 5 page paper in Spring 2021 for a class entitled Imperial Nature. It was in response to the prompt, “In giving her book a paradoxical title, The Global Interior, Megan Black highlights her central argument: that the Department of the Interior played a major role in projecting American power beyond its borders, initially in the context of settler-colonial expansion and later on a global scale, helping the US to push an imperial agenda that was at once plain for all to see, yet somehow also obscured from view. In a paper 4-6 pages in length that draws on evidence and examples from the book, assess the major strengths and weaknesses of the book. How did the Department of the Interior help the U.S. to build an empire hiding in plain sight?” This paper is both a literary analysis and a deconstruction of the traditional perception of the US Department of the Interior.\nPlanting the Seeds of Women in Agriculture\nI wrote this 10 page paper in Fall 2018 for the class People, Agriculture, and the Environment. After visiting two farms near Osceola, Wisconsin, each student was assigned to focus on a different aspect of modern farming. I chose to focus my research on the importance of women in agriculture and how to get more women involved.\nBuilding Blocks of Hate: Factors that influence hate crime rates in the United States\nI created this StoryMap using ArcGIS Online in Spring 2020 for my Introduction to GIS and Cartography course. In it, I seek to answer two questions through geovisual and graphical analysis. The questions are:\nHow does income inequality relate to hate crime rates in US states?\nHow do 2016 presidential election results relate to hate crime rates in US states?\n\n\n\n",
