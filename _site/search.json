      "contents": "\nMacalester Jewish Organization (MJO)\nI joined the Macalester Jewish Organization my sophomore year and became a co-president my junior year. I was raised only culturally Jewish, but I was drawn to MJO by the well-organized, strong community. As a co-president, I run our leadership meetings, help to organize hundred person services for the High Holidays, and plan weekly programming including cultural meetings and Shabbats. MJO is the only source of Jewish life on campus, so our programming is essential for religious students.\nChallah for Hunger\nI became involved with Challah for Hunger through MJO, and restarted Macalester’s chapter of the national organization my senior year after it took a pause during COVID. As president, I organized fundraising approval and arranged teams of volunteers three multi-part bake sales a semester. One team would mix ingredients for challah, the second would braid mini challahs after it rose, and the third would sell each challah for $1 during lunch the following day. We raised about $400 in the Fall 2021 semester, increasing our fundraising by more than 400% over Fall 2019. Half of the proceeds were donated to the national organization Swipe Out Hunger and half were donated to Macalester’s Little Free Pantry.\nCampus Hunger Project Cohort\nEach year, Challah for Hunger national organizes a cohort of students from colleges around the country to participate in the Campus Hunger Project. As cohort fellows, we each spearhead a project on our own campus to combat food insecurity with the support of other members. For my project, I’m mentoring an underclassman and working to establish a chapter of Swipe Out Hunger on Macalester’s campus, with the long term goal of creating a meal swipe donation program.\n\n\n\n",

      "contents": "\nCommunication with the Masses: The Future of Ecology\nI wrote this op-ed for my Ecology and the Environment class in Fall 2019 in response to the prompt “What should the future of ecology be?” In the paper, I argue that ecologists and scientists in general must place more of an effort on non-science communication in order to stay relevant.\nThe American Empire: The Global Interior and the True International Role of the Department of the Interior\nI wrote this 5 page paper in Spring 2021 for a class entitled Imperial Nature. It was in response to the prompt, “In giving her book a paradoxical title, The Global Interior, Megan Black highlights her central argument: that the Department of the Interior played a major role in projecting American power beyond its borders, initially in the context of settler-colonial expansion and later on a global scale, helping the US to push an imperial agenda that was at once plain for all to see, yet somehow also obscured from view. In a paper 4-6 pages in length that draws on evidence and examples from the book, assess the major strengths and weaknesses of the book. How did the Department of the Interior help the U.S. to build an empire hiding in plain sight?” This paper is both a literary analysis and a deconstruction of the traditional perception of the US Department of the Interior.\nPlanting the Seeds of Women in Agriculture\nI wrote this 10 page paper in Fall 2018 for the class People, Agriculture, and the Environment. After visiting two farms near Osceola, Wisconsin, each student was assigned to focus on a different aspect of modern farming. I chose to focus my research on the importance of women in agriculture and how to get more women involved.\nBuilding Blocks of Hate: Factors that influence hate crime rates in the United States\nI created this StoryMap using ArcGIS Online in Spring 2020 for my Introduction to GIS and Cartography course. In it, I seek to answer two questions through geovisual and graphical analysis. The questions are:\nHow does income inequality relate to hate crime rates in US states?\nHow do 2016 presidential election results relate to hate crime rates in US states?\n\n\n\n",
