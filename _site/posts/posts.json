As expected, Netflix has been much more dominant than the other two, reaching a maximum of 14 nominations in 2020, but the comparitive value of this information will increase as the other services grow. I chose to color each service based on the coloring in its logo, making the legend necessary only to those who are unfamiliar with them.\n\n\n\n",
